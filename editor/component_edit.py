"""Unified component selection and dragging — Radiant-style direct editing.

This module is the single place Fio answers four questions that used to have
(or would otherwise grow) four unrelated answers:

* what is under the cursor — an object, a face, an edge or a vertex?
* which side of a brush is the cursor asking to stretch?
* how does dragging that component change the brush?
* which brushes does a Radiant-style selection operation catch?

It reproduces the *workflow* a GtkRadiant mapper expects — point at geometry,
click it, drag it, use a modifier to change what the drag means — implemented
natively on Fio's own convex plane-set geometry.  There is no second geometry
representation: every query reads the ``ConvexGeometry`` that
:mod:`engine.brush_geometry` already caches per brush, and every edit goes back
through that module's plane helpers, so only the edited brush's caches are
touched.

Performance contract
--------------------
Everything here is **event driven**.  Nothing in this module is called from a
render loop:

* picking is invoked from mouse press / hover handlers only, and only ever
  tests the brushes it is given — the caller passes the current selection, so a
  component pick is O(selected brushes), never O(scene);
* a drag captures the affected brushes' state **once** at mouse-down and
  recomputes from that snapshot, so a mouse move does no scene-wide work and
  cannot accumulate drift;
* overlay geometry for highlighting is built on demand and cached behind a
  version counter (:meth:`ComponentController.version`), so a renderer can skip
  the rebuild entirely while nothing has changed.

The module is deliberately Qt-free (NumPy only) so it can be unit-tested
head-less and reused by both the 2D views and the 3D viewport.
