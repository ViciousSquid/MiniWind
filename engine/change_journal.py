"""Runtime change notification for the dense render projections.

The render tables (:class:`engine.render_table.RenderTable`,
:class:`engine.entity_table.EntityTable`) are a numeric copy of the scene.
Copying is only cheap if it happens when something changes, not every frame
for everything that *might* have: a frame that re-reads every entity's
position, sprite state and light settings to find the handful that moved
spends almost all of its time confirming that nothing happened.

So the objects say when they change. There are two kinds of change:

* :data:`MOVED` -- only the transform. ``Thing.pos`` records this itself on
  assignment (see :class:`TrackedPosition`), so the AI, physics, movers and
  plugins that move entities by assigning ``pos`` need do nothing more.
* :data:`STATE` -- anything else a row is resolved from: a property the
  renderer reads (``hidden``, ``dead``, a light's ``state``, a brush's tint),
  or runtime render state (a carried prop's yaw, a respawn fade, an effect
  being triggered). Whoever writes such a value calls :func:`touch`.
* :data:`VISIBILITY` -- only the live ``hidden`` flag, written by a streaming
  layer that parks the object; ``touch(obj, VISIBILITY)``.

Editor transactions still go through
:meth:`editor.editor_state.EditorState.mark_world_changed`; this journal is
for what changes while the world is running, where there is no undo
checkpoint to hang a notification on.

Each table subscribes itself when built and :meth:`ChangeJournal.drain`\\ s its
own pending set once per frame, so the two double-buffered tables each see every
change, whichever of them the next frame is built in. A subscriber that stops
draining (a table no frame uses any more) is capped at
:data:`PENDING_LIMIT` entries and then told to refresh everything, so it
cannot grow without bound.
