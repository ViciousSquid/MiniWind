"""
Camera render-distance cull -- the pure, GL-free geometry of it.

The renderer's main camera pass runs this cheap broad-phase cull *before*
``_sort_objects`` (and on top of the frustum cull it already does): any object
whose centre lies farther than the camera's view distance on the XZ plane is
dropped. Distances are compared squared, so no square root runs per object.

The radius itself is *not* here any more. It is a live camera setting the
editor and the console can move mid-session, so it lives on
:class:`engine.view_distance.ViewDistance` and the renderer reads it per frame;
:data:`CAMERA_RENDER_CULL_DISTANCE` below is only that setting's default value,
kept under its old name for callers and tests that want the number.

The logic lives here, apart from :mod:`engine.renderer_F`, for two reasons: it
carries no OpenGL/glm/Qt dependency, so it is unit-testable headlessly; and it
keeps the renderer's per-frame path a thin call over a persistent scratch buffer
(no per-frame list allocation). The shadow and portal passes deliberately do not
call this -- they keep operating on the full scene.

    """The XZ box the camera can actually see, given the world's height slab.

    Fio has two play cameras and the player switches between them mid-session, so
    one fixed radius cannot serve both.  Overhead floats ``overhead_height``
    above the player raked by ``overhead_tilt``: its frustum leaves the world's
    vertical slab almost immediately, and the ground it covers is a box a couple
    of thousand units across rather than the tens of thousands a far plane at
    10,000 would suggest.  First person sits at the player and looks out to the
    ceiling.  A radius wide enough for the second draws a ring of world nobody
    can see in the first.

    So the region is derived from the live camera instead.  *corners* are the
    four far-plane corner points in world space; with *cam* they span the view
    pyramid.  That pyramid is cut down to what lies within *max_dist* of the
    camera, then clipped to the slab ``[y_min, y_max]`` the world's geometry
    occupies, and the answer is the XZ bounds of what survives.

    The clip is exact rather than sampled.  A convex solid cut by two parallel
    planes has as vertices only its own vertices inside the slab and the points
    where its edges cross the planes, so every segment between two of the five
    points is clipped and its surviving ends collected.  Sampling only the
    corner rays is not enough: in a level first-person view over a thin world
    they leave the slab within a few hundred units, while the far face still
    crosses it thousands of units to either side.

    Both modes are served by the same arithmetic.  At low pitch the pyramid
    stays in the slab and the result is its footprint out to *max_dist*; at a
    steep pitch the slab clip dominates and the box shrinks to the patch of
    ground below.  It is stateless, so a mid-play mode switch cannot leave it
    stale -- but a *caller* that caches the box against the player's position
    can, because the box changes on a switch while the player has not moved.

    This is a *visibility* answer, not a residency one (§15).  Big World decides
    what is resident, from the **player's** position; this decides what of that
    is drawn, from the **camera's**.  Keeping those two inputs separate is what
    stops a camera toggle from streaming cells in or out: in first person the
    visible box can reach past the activation radius, and it must not drag the
    world's resident set out with it.  Narrowing this box never unloads anything
    and never suppresses simulation.

    Returns ``(min_x, min_z, max_x, max_z)``.  Conservative by construction: the
    bounding box of the visible volume, never smaller than it.  (It bounds the
    volume, not what an AABB-against-planes test accepts: that test also passes
    some boxes near the frustum's edges that lie wholly outside it.)

    Pure arithmetic -- no glm, no GL -- so it is unit-testable headlessly.
