"""
Camera render-distance cull -- the pure, GL-free geometry of it.

The renderer's main camera pass runs this cheap broad-phase cull *before*
``_sort_objects`` (and on top of the frustum cull it already does): any object
whose centre lies farther than the camera's view distance on the XZ plane is
dropped. Distances are compared squared, so no square root runs per object.

The radius itself is *not* here any more. It is a live camera setting the
editor and the console can move mid-session, so it lives on
:class:`engine.view_distance.ViewDistance` and the renderer reads it per frame;
:data:`CAMERA_RENDER_CULL_DISTANCE` below is only that setting's default value,
kept under its old name for callers and tests that want the number.

The logic lives here, apart from :mod:`engine.renderer_F`, for two reasons: it
carries no OpenGL/glm/Qt dependency, so it is unit-testable headlessly; and it
keeps the renderer's per-frame path a thin call over a persistent scratch buffer
(no per-frame list allocation). The shadow and portal passes deliberately do not
call this -- they keep operating on the full scene.

    """The XZ box the camera can actually see, given the world's height slab.

    Fio has two play cameras and the player switches between them mid-session, so
    one fixed radius cannot serve both.  Overhead floats ``overhead_height``
    above the player raked by ``overhead_tilt``: its frustum leaves the world's
    vertical slab almost immediately, and the ground it covers is a box a couple
    of thousand units across rather than the tens of thousands a far plane at
    10,000 would suggest.  First person sits at the player and looks out to the
    ceiling.  A radius wide enough for the second draws a ring of world nobody
    can see in the first.

    So the region is derived from the live camera instead.  *corners* are the
    four far-plane corner points in world space; each is clipped as a segment
    from *cam*, first to *max_dist* and then to the slab ``[y_min, y_max]`` the
    world's geometry occupies.  The XZ bounds of what survives is the answer,
    plus the camera's own XZ when it sits inside the slab, so nothing directly
    beneath a first-person camera is ever dropped.

    Both modes are served by the same arithmetic, and the degenerate one is the
    safe one: at low pitch the corner rays stay inside the slab for their whole
    length, the slab clip does nothing, and the result collapses to the
    far-plane footprint bounded by *max_dist* -- the distance ceiling Fio culled
    by before.  So this can be called unconditionally; it tightens the overhead
    case and reproduces the old behaviour in first person.  It is stateless, so
    a mid-play mode switch cannot leave it stale -- but a *caller* that caches
    the box against the player's position can, because the box changes on a
    switch while the player has not moved.

    This is a *visibility* answer, not a residency one (§15).  Big World decides
    what is resident, from the **player's** position; this decides what of that
    is drawn, from the **camera's**.  Keeping those two inputs separate is what
    stops a camera toggle from streaming cells in or out: in first person the
    visible box can reach past the activation radius, and it must not drag the
    world's resident set out with it.  Narrowing this box never unloads anything
    and never suppresses simulation.

    Returns ``(min_x, min_z, max_x, max_z)``.  Conservative by construction: the
    bounding box of the visible volume, never smaller than it.

    Pure arithmetic -- no glm, no GL -- so it is unit-testable headlessly.
