"""The dense terrain projection: one row per resident terrain chunk.

:mod:`engine.render_table` and :mod:`engine.entity_table` gave brushes and
entities a dense projection, so the renderer stopped asking every object what
it was on every frame. Terrain kept a ``dict`` of ``TerrainChunk`` dataclasses
and walked it in Python several times a frame -- residency, visibility, LOD and
the build queue were each a per-chunk loop -- and it kept *two* height grids
per chunk: a 33x33 one for collision and the 49x49 one the mesh was built
from, which disagreed by up to a few units on sculpted ground.

A :class:`TerrainTable` is the same kind of thing as its two siblings:

* **GL-free.** It holds numbers, never GL names. The terrain renderer keeps
  its GL objects in arrays indexed by the same ``slot``.
* **A projection, not a source.** Every value is derived from the terrain's
  procedural height function and the camera; throwing the table away and
  streaming again reproduces it exactly.
* **Addressed by slot, named by chunk coordinate.** ``slot_of_coord`` is the
  cache-boundary mechanism (crossed when a chunk enters or leaves, and by a
  collision query); frame code works on whole columns.

It differs where terrain differs. Rows are not authored objects, so there is
no UUID and no change journal: the row set moves with the streaming ring, and
a row goes stale when its heights change (a sculpt edit, a biome change),
which the terrain reports through :meth:`mark_dirty_region` /
:meth:`mark_all_dirty`. And a row carries a height grid -- 49x49 floats -- far
too much to double-buffer the way RenderState buffers the other two tables,
so the table has one writer (the thread that builds chunks) and readers on
other threads use a per-slot sequence number instead (:meth:`height_at`).

**One heightfield.** :attr:`heights` holds the grid a chunk was last built
at, and it is what both consumers read: the renderer draws it, and collision
interpolates it over the *same triangles* (the same quad diagonal) the
renderer draws. The player stands on the surface they can see.

**Absence is explicit.** A map without terrain has no ``Terrain`` and so no
table; nothing here is allocated for an ordinary map.

Every method below is an exact, vectorised port of the per-chunk loop it
replaced in :mod:`engine.terrain` (kept, frozen, in
``tests/helpers/terrain_reference.py``) -- the same float64 arithmetic in the
same order, so its decisions are the old decisions, not approximations of them.
