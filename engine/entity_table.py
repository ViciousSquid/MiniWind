"""The dense entity projection -- the other half of T3.

:mod:`engine.render_table` gave Fio's *brushes* a dense projection: one row per
brush, columns of plain NumPy, so the renderer stopped asking every visible
brush what it was on every frame.  Entities did not get one.  The comment in
``renderer_F.render_scene`` says so plainly --

    # Things keep the object path: they are not projected, and their
    # render kinds are entity semantics rather than material state.

-- and the cost of that is two Python walks over every entity in the level,
every frame:

* the logic thread's publish loop, which reads ``thing.pos``, stores two floats
  into a NumPy buffer *one element at a time*, and runs three ``isinstance``
  tests, to produce the position buffer, the light list and the visible set;
* ``_sort_objects``' Thing half, which runs four more ``isinstance`` tests, a
  ``str().lower()``, a tuple build and a tuple compare per entity to decide
  which pass draws it.

Measured at 961 entities that is 0.65 ms and 0.81 ms per frame -- together
about a tenth of a 60 Hz budget, spent re-deriving facts that are fixed for an
entity's lifetime.

"Entity semantics rather than material state" is true and is not a reason to
keep them in Python.  *Which pass draws an entity* is a resolution of its class
and four authored properties; it is as static as a brush's shader.  What is
genuinely dynamic -- where the entity is, whether it is hidden, whether a
Prop has been collected -- is dynamic for brushes too, and the brush table
already has the discipline for it.  So this module applies the same one.

What it is, and is not
----------------------
Identical in kind to :class:`engine.render_table.RenderTable`, deliberately:

* it stores nothing authored.  Every column resolves something the entity
  already says, so rebuilding the table from ``EditorState.things`` gives
  identical bits;
* it is never written back to.  (A ``glm`` vector assigned to ``pos`` is
  stored as a list by the setter, where it is assigned, not repaired here.)
* identity stays the entity's own UUID.  ``slot`` is an *address*, valid within
  one :attr:`generation`; ``properties['id']`` is the *name*.  Frame code
  indexes columns by slot and never looks a name up.

Refresh discipline
------------------
Nothing is re-read per frame. A row is resolved when the row set changes or
the editor's world epoch moves, and again whenever :mod:`engine.change_journal`
names its entity:

* assigning ``Thing.pos`` journals the move itself -- the AI, physics,
  parented lights and portals, plugins and the editor all move entities by
  assignment;
* runtime render state that is not authored -- a carried Prop's yaw, a respawn
  fade, a portal's fade, an Effect's playback clock -- is a
  :class:`~engine.change_journal.TrackedAttribute` and journals itself too;
* everything else a row reads (``hidden``, a Monster's ``dead`` and
  ``is_shooting``, a Light's state) is written by code that calls ``touch``:
  the I/O dispatcher after every input, the parking-aware flag writer, the
  monster AI when a flag actually changes, the console, save restores.

The one per-frame computation is the Effect clock -- elapsed time, liveness and
the flickering light -- and it is column arithmetic over the Effect rows.
A row whose object cannot journal (a raw dict standing in for a Thing) has its
position and ``hidden`` read per frame instead.

Entity classes are imported defensively, the way :mod:`engine.logic_thread`
imports them, so a tier without ``editor.things`` -- the standalone player, a
head-less test -- still imports this module.
