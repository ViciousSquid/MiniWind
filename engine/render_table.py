"""The dense render projection of Fio's world -- T3.

Fio already pays to describe its world numerically: :meth:`LogicThread._build_cull_cache`
keeps AABB centres and half-extents in NumPy so the frustum test can run as two
matmuls instead of a per-brush Python loop.  What it does not keep is anything
about *what* a brush is -- its shader class, whether it is water, which texture
sits on each face -- so the moment culling finishes, the renderer has to go back
to the brush dicts and rediscover all of it, every frame, for every visible
object.  ``is_water_brush`` alone is six ``str.lower()`` calls and six substring
searches per brush per frame, answering a question that only changes when
somebody retextures the brush in the editor.

This module holds that missing half.  A :class:`RenderTable` is a *projection*
of the brush list: one row per brush, columns of plain NumPy, addressed by an
integer ``slot``.  It is emphatically **not** a second world --

* it stores nothing authored.  Every column is a resolution of something the
  brush dict already says, so deleting the whole table and rebuilding it from
  ``EditorState.brushes`` yields identical bits;
* it is never written back to.  The projection is read-only with respect to the
  world; the one write the world needs (stamping a brush's UUID) lives in
  :meth:`EditorState.ensure_entity_ids`, in the module that owns the world;
* it holds no identity of its own.  Rows are named by the brush's existing
  ``brush['id']`` UUID -- the same id undo uses to re-point the selection at the
  dict that replaced it.  A ``slot`` is an *address*, valid only within one
  :attr:`generation`; the id is the *name*, and the map between them is a
  cache-boundary mechanism, not a per-frame lookup.

That last distinction is the whole point.  Frame code does
``class_bits[visible_slots]``, never ``slot_of_id[some_id]``.  Replacing a
Python object lookup with a Python dict lookup would move the cost sideways, not
remove it.

Deliberately GL-free.  Texture *names* are interned to dense integers here; the
renderer maps those to GL texture ids on its own thread, where a GL context
exists (see :meth:`RenderTable.texture_names`).  That keeps the whole module
unit-testable headlessly, the way :mod:`engine.render_cull` is, and keeps the
logic thread from ever needing a context.

Refresh discipline
------------------
A row is re-read when something says it changed, never to find out whether it
did:

* **editor transactions** move the world epoch and journal their objects
  (:meth:`EditorState.mark_world_changed`); those rows are re-resolved, in
  place when the row set is unchanged;
* **runtime changes** -- I/O inputs, console commands, Big World parking, a
  save restore -- go through :mod:`engine.change_journal`, which each table
  drains once per frame;
* **movers and doors** move every tick with no notification, so their
  transforms (:attr:`RenderTable.dynamic_slots`) are re-read every frame;
* **an editor drag** writes the selection's dicts in place for many frames
  after one undo checkpoint, so the frame passes the selection as *edited* and
  only those rows' transforms are re-read.

``hidden`` is a column like any other. Big World parks through it and I/O
Hide/Show toggles it, both via :func:`engine.spatial.set_authored_flag`, which
journals the object. ``class_bits`` separately carries the *authored* value
(:func:`engine.spatial.authored_hidden`), as the collision grid does.

On a still frame the table reads nothing but the movers; Debug Tables shows
the count (``rows read last frame``).
