"""The dense render projection of Fio's world -- T3.

Fio already pays to describe its world numerically: :meth:`LogicThread._build_cull_cache`
keeps AABB centres and half-extents in NumPy so the frustum test can run as two
matmuls instead of a per-brush Python loop.  What it does not keep is anything
about *what* a brush is -- its shader class, whether it is water, which texture
sits on each face -- so the moment culling finishes, the renderer has to go back
to the brush dicts and rediscover all of it, every frame, for every visible
object.  ``is_water_brush`` alone is six ``str.lower()`` calls and six substring
searches per brush per frame, answering a question that only changes when
somebody retextures the brush in the editor.

This module holds that missing half.  A :class:`RenderTable` is a *projection*
of the brush list: one row per brush, columns of plain NumPy, addressed by an
integer ``slot``.  It is emphatically **not** a second world --

* it stores nothing authored.  Every column is a resolution of something the
  brush dict already says, so deleting the whole table and rebuilding it from
  ``EditorState.brushes`` yields identical bits;
* it is never written back to.  The projection is read-only with respect to the
  world; the one write the world needs (stamping a brush's UUID) lives in
  :meth:`EditorState.ensure_entity_ids`, in the module that owns the world;
* it holds no identity of its own.  Rows are named by the brush's existing
  ``brush['id']`` UUID -- the same id undo uses to re-point the selection at the
  dict that replaced it.  A ``slot`` is an *address*, valid only within one
  :attr:`generation`; the id is the *name*, and the map between them is a
  cache-boundary mechanism, not a per-frame lookup.

That last distinction is the whole point.  Frame code does
``class_bits[visible_slots]``, never ``slot_of_id[some_id]``.  Replacing a
Python object lookup with a Python dict lookup would move the cost sideways, not
remove it.

Deliberately GL-free.  Texture *names* are interned to dense integers here; the
renderer maps those to GL texture ids on its own thread, where a GL context
exists (see :meth:`RenderTable.texture_names`).  That keeps the whole module
unit-testable headlessly, the way :mod:`engine.render_cull` is, and keeps the
logic thread from ever needing a context.

Refresh discipline
------------------
Columns are grouped by *how often they change*, which turns out to line up with
*how expensive they are to recompute*:

``cold``
    classification and material -- ``class_bits``, ``tex_name_id``, the UV
    columns, ``geo_epoch``.  Expensive (dict walks, string searches) and changed
    only by an editor edit or an I/O handler, both of which have a choke point.
    Refreshed when the world epoch moves, never per frame.

``warm``
    ``center``, ``half``, ``rot``.  Cheap (a handful of float copies) and
    changed every tick by movers and doors, which have no per-tick notification
    and should not grow one.  Refreshed unconditionally for the rows that move.

The one field deliberately left out of ``cold`` is the *live* ``hidden`` flag.
Big World parks objects by writing ``hidden`` directly and relies on every
per-frame consumer reading it live -- see :data:`engine.spatial.PARKED_HIDDEN_KEY`
-- so caching it would break streaming.  ``class_bits`` therefore carries the
*authored* value via :func:`engine.spatial.authored_hidden`, exactly as the
collision grid does, and the live flag stays a per-frame read.

    this builds the whole batch at once from columns that already exist instead

    Almost every brush in a Fio level is unrotated, and there that collapses to
    a diagonal plus a translation: six stores per row and no trigonometry, for
    the entire visible set in a handful of NumPy operations.  The rotated

    column-major -- the layout ``glUniformMatrix4fv`` and ``glUniformMatrix3fv``
    read directly, and the layout an instance buffer wants.

    The normal matrix is ``transpose(inverse(mat3(M)))``, which for ``R * S``
    is ``R * S**-1``; a zero extent degenerates to zero rather than infinity,
