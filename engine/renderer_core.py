"""
engine/renderer_core.py  –  Base renderer with shared logic for Forward/Deferred

Provides:
    • Texture management (load_texture, preload_level_textures)
    • Grid drawing (update_grid_buffers, draw_grid)
    • Sprite rendering (dense instanced EntityTable path)
    • Model loading & dense instanced drawing
    • Water / Glass / Fog volume rendering
    • Terrain rendering
    • Editor helpers (gizmo, selection outline, face highlight, connection lines,
      path node cubes, portal wireframes)
    • Projected shadows
    • Dense slot classification / sorting helpers
    • VAO creation for cube, sprite, grid, gizmo, etc.
    • Shader management (compilation, hot‑reload, light upload)

Both Renderer_F and Renderer_D inherit from BaseRenderer.
