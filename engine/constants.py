      because it builds a durable index that has to outlive a streaming layer
      parking a cell (see ``engine.spatial``), and it files water separately
      rather than discarding it.
    * ``Player._blocks_player`` adds ``disabled`` and ``_physics_body`` on top
      of this, because it classifies movers and doors -- which never went
      through the grid -- and because a dynamic body is simulated rather than
      collided with as a wall.
