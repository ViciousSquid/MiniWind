"""Numerical render keys, and the state runs they sort into.

Quake 3's backend never asks a surface what it is.  The frontend packs a
surface's state -- its shader, entity, fog and dynamic-light bits -- into the
integer ``drawSurf_t.sort``, sorts that array, and the backend walks it
changing GL state only where the decoded key changes.  Classification happens
once, numerically, at the front; submission is a walk over sorted integers.

This module is that boundary for Fio, and nothing more.  It is deliberately
small and deliberately GL-free:

* :class:`KeyLayout` declares what a pass's key is made of and packs the dense
  columns describing it into one sortable ``int64`` per item;
* :func:`sort_into_runs` sorts those keys and reports where each stretch of
  equal keys begins and ends.

A *run* is then the unit the renderer submits: everything in it shares the GPU
state the key encodes, so that state is established once, and everything that
differs within it -- the transform, the colour, the UV mapping -- travels as
instance data.  Which fields belong in the key is exactly the question "what
cannot vary within one draw", and it is answered per pass rather than here.

Nothing in this module knows about brushes, OpenGL or the renderer, so the key
design of a pass is unit-testable on its own.
