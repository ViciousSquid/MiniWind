"""
Camera view distance and far-plane fog -- the pure, GL-free state behind it.

This is a **renderer/camera** setting, not a world-streaming one. Big World
decides which cells are loaded and simulated, from the *player's* position;
this decides how far the *camera* draws, and it never unloads anything, never
suppresses simulation and never narrows the resident set. The two cooperate --
the renderer only ever draws what is already resident -- but they stay separate
knobs, so pulling the far plane in to 2,000 on a slow machine changes nothing
about the world except how much of it is on screen.

The editor's "Cull Dist" spinbox and the ``r_viewdistance`` console command
both write :attr:`ViewDistance.distance` here, and everything downstream reads
it: the broad-phase distance cull, the projection's far plane, the logic
thread's frustum, and the distance fog the shaders apply.

**Fog and clipping work together.** A far plane on its own pops geometry out of
existence at a hard edge. So the fog is derived from the same distance and is
guaranteed to reach full opacity *before* the clip: by default fog starts at
60% of the view distance and is fully opaque at 92% of it, leaving the last 8%
as a margin in which nothing can be seen anyway. :meth:`ViewDistance.resolve`
enforces that ordering even when a map or a console command asks for something
else, so a hard pop-out is not reachable through the public API.

Fog is measured as the true radial distance from the camera to the fragment
(not view-space depth), which is what the shaders compute, so the fog wall is a
sphere around the eye and does not swim as the camera turns.

No GL, no glm, no Qt -- unit-testable headlessly.
