"""The one and only Prop entity class.

A Prop is a core engine primitive: a carryable world object with optional
physics. It must exist identically in all three execution contexts:

* the editor (``editor.things`` available, PyQt5 loaded),
* editor play mode (same process as the editor),
* the standalone ``.fiopak`` player / Android build (no PyQt5).

There is therefore exactly one ``Prop`` class, defined here. Its base class is
resolved once, at import, by the same rule every plugin entity uses:
``editor.things.Model`` when the editor tier can be imported, otherwise the
dependency-free :class:`plugins.entitybase.Model`. Within any one process there
is a single ``Prop`` object; ``editor.things.Prop`` and ``plugins.entitybase.Prop``
are lazy aliases of it, never separate implementations.

This module itself imports no Qt, OpenGL or NumPy. Editor-only behaviour
(the 2D billboard pixmap) is reached through a helper on the editor ``Thing``
base and is simply absent when that base is the headless fallback.
