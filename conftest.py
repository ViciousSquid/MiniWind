"""Repo-wide pytest configuration.

This file exists so that *every* Fio test — the unified suite under ``tests/``
and the tests the plugin and player packages ship with — runs under the same
rules:

* Qt is forced onto the offscreen platform plugin, so nothing needs a display
  server;
* the RNGs Fio's procedural code reaches for are reseeded before each test, so
  a failure reproduces;
* the process-wide singletons Fio uses (the plugin manager, the I/O revision
  counter, the ``Thing`` name counters) are reset between tests, so a test
  cannot be made to pass or fail by whatever ran before it;
* the ``gl`` tier skips itself with a readable reason when no OpenGL context
  can be created, rather than erroring somewhere deep in PyOpenGL.

See ``tests/README.md`` for how the tiers are meant to be run.

    ``_isolate_process_singletons`` restores ``IO_REGISTRY`` to whatever it held
    at the *start of each test*, so a test that registers a fake entity type
    cannot leak it into the next one. But plugin registration is a
    once-per-process event: ``PluginManager.discover_and_load`` early-outs on
    ``self._loaded``. So if the first ``load_plugins()`` of the process happened
    inside a test, that test's teardown rolled the registry back to before the
    plugins registered and nothing ever registered them again -- every later
    test saw a plugin that is loaded and enabled but whose I/O and entity
    declarations had silently vanished.

    That is why ``plugins/tidy/tests/test_smoke.py::test_plugin_loads_and_registers``
    passes alone and fails when another tidy test runs first. Loading here, at
    session scope, puts the plugin registrations *inside* every per-test
    snapshot, so restoring a snapshot preserves them while still dropping
    anything an individual test added.

    Guarded: the headless CI tier has no PyQt5, so plugin import can fail there.
    That tier simply runs without plugins, exactly as before.

    Fio keeps several deliberate singletons: the plugin manager, the I/O
    revision counter and its cached reverse index, ``IO_REGISTRY`` (the
    process-wide schema of every entity type's inputs and outputs), and
    ``Thing._counters`` (which is what makes entity names unique).  A test that
    adds a connection, registers an entity type or places an entity changes what
    the *next* test sees, which is exactly the kind of order dependence that
    makes a suite untrustworthy.  Everything here is restored, not merely
    cleared, so a test that deliberately sets one of them up still sees its own
    value.

    ``IO_REGISTRY`` matters more than it looks: several tests register a fake
    entity type to exercise the registration path, and a leftover fake is a type
    declaring inputs that nothing implements — which is precisely what the I/O
    conformance tests exist to catch, so a leak there shows up as a failure
    about Fio's own entities.
