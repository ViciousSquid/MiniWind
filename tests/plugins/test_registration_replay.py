"""Plugin registrations must be restorable, not fire-once.

``PluginManager.discover_and_load`` early-outs on ``self._loaded``, so a
plugin's ``register()`` runs once per process and never again. The registries
it writes into -- ``editor.io_system.IO_REGISTRY`` and
``editor.things.ENTITY_TYPES`` -- are module-level singletons. Anything that
resets one of them therefore used to strip the plugins' declarations with no
way to get them back: the plugin stayed loaded and enabled while its I/O and
entity types silently vanished, and which tests had run first decided whether
the next one saw a working plugin.
