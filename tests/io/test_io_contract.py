"""Every declared input runs something; every declared output is fired.

Fio keeps the *declaration* of an entity's I/O (``IO_REGISTRY``, global, built
at import) apart from its *implementation* (an ``IOManager``'s handler table,
per-session, partly supplied by plugins at runtime). They cannot be one
structure — the lifetimes differ — so they can drift, and a drifted declaration
is invisible: the editor offers the input, a designer wires it, nothing runs,
and no error appears anywhere.

This file is the reconciliation. It asserts, for the whole registry:

* every declared input has **exactly one** implementation — a registered
  handler, or the generic dispatcher, never both-and-neither, and never
  registered twice;
* every declared input is **demonstrable**: invoked through the real dispatcher
  on a real instance of its type, it reaches an implementation and does not
  raise;
* every declared output has an **emission path** somewhere in the source;
* nothing is implemented that is not declared, so no input is reachable only by
  someone who already knows its name.

The single sanctioned exception is :data:`editor.io_system.ABSTRACT_IO`, which
these tests read rather than keeping a list of their own — so an entry that is
inert on purpose is stated once, next to the declaration.
