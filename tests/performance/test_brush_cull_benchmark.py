"""The brush frustum cull on a 24 000-brush world, per camera pose.

Prints how many rows are visible and what the cull costs end to end: the
shown mask, the frustum test over every row, and the slots that pass, exactly
as ``LogicThread._prepare_render_state`` runs it. Reported, not asserted.

For the record, a grid-assisted broad phase (occupied 512-unit cells ->
slots, cell boxes through the same test) was built and measured against this.
It returned identical slots. Against the box-major test (0.85-0.97 ms here)
it paid: 0.21-0.74 ms. Against the plane-major test (0.24-0.30 ms) it cost
more in wide views (0.35-0.48 ms) and saved at most 0.15 ms in narrow ones.
Gathering a candidate row costs about as much as testing it, so the grid
cannot beat a full pass by much. It was removed; see the history of this
file.
