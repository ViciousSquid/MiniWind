"""Work-per-frame guards for the engine's hot paths.

The companion module (``test_hot_path_integrity``) guards the geometry and
component-editing paths.  This one covers what the *running game* does every
tick: the cull buffers, the collision-brush concatenation, the I/O reverse
index, the AI's spatial queries, and the per-frame plugin gate.

Like its companion, every assertion here counts work rather than timing it.  A
test that pinned a microsecond budget would fail on a slow runner and teach
nobody anything; a test that says "this rebuilt the array 60 times a second when
it should have built it once" says exactly what regressed.
