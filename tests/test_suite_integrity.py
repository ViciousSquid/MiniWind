"""The suite checking on itself.

Two defects in this repository's history were invisible for exactly one
reason: a test file existed, so it read as coverage, while never executing.

* ``tests/renderer/test_light_budget.py`` carried literal ``\\n\\n`` escapes
  instead of newlines and was a ``SyntaxError`` -- the whole light-UBO rewrite,
  eleven repair commits long, had no working coverage.
* ``tests/io/test_io_contract.py`` had a dedented function tail and raised
  ``NameError`` at import.

Either one aborts the *entire* pytest run (``Interrupted: N errors during
collection``), so nothing else ran either and the cause was a traceback rather
than a named failure.

These checks turn that class of breakage into an ordinary test failure that
names the file, while the rest of the suite still runs. They are static: every
module is compiled, not imported, so they cost almost nothing and have no
side effects.
