"""Which file the open level belongs to, after every way a level can arrive.

``save_level`` writes ``file_path`` with no questions asked, so ``file_path`` is
a promise: "this scene is that file".  Two load paths broke it:

* the procedural generator loaded its map through a temp file and then deleted
  it, leaving ``file_path`` on the deleted temp file, the scene marked clean and
  the temp path in Recent Files — Ctrl+S "saved" into the temp directory and
  closing the editor discarded the map without a prompt;
* a load that failed after the old scene had been cleared left ``file_path`` on
  the *previous* map, so the next Ctrl+S wrote the half-built scene over it.
