"""What Export Game Package writes, checked by reading the archive back.

The exporter had no behavioural coverage, and several of its promises were not
kept: the manifest was written before its ``map_path`` was filled in, a level
change's target map was only followed when the dialog supplied a start map
(it never does), and asset references were copied from wherever they pointed —
an absolute path or a ``../`` climb produced an archive entry outside the
package root.  Every test here builds a small project on disk, exports it, and
opens the result with the player's own reader.
