"""Back-face culling in the main view's opaque brush passes.

An opaque brush is a closed solid, so from outside it the faces turned away
from the camera are always behind the ones turned towards it. Culling them
changes no pixel, apart from a few depth ties along silhouette edges, which
it settles the right way (see below). What it does change is how many fragments reach the
depth test: on the 24 000-brush stress map, 50-60% of the faces submitted
faced away. Depth-passing fragments per covered pixel fell from 1.34-2.06 to
1.19-1.44, and the opaque passes got 20-45% cheaper on Mesa in the
overhead and editor views.

These check the "no pixel" half on real geometry, boxes and clipped convex
brushes alike (the two wind oppositely), and that the saving is real. They
also check that nothing else is culled: transparent passes, whose far faces
show through the near ones, and the wireframe and vertex modes, whose far
edges are part of the view.
