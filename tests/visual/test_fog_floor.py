"""Standing inside a fog volume, the floor fogs like the walls and ceiling.

The fog pass ray-marches from the camera to where the ray leaves the volume,
drawn on the face it leaves through. It drew five faces of a box volume: the
bottom was left out (a pattern copied from the water pass, where the floor
hides it). From inside, the floor is seen through that bottom face, so it
showed through stark and unfogged. The bottom face also usually lies exactly
on the floor, so it is drawn pulled a hair towards the camera, or it would
z-fight it into stripes.
