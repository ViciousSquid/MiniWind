"""The numeric path must draw exactly what the object path drew.

``Renderer_F.render_scene`` has two ways through the brush half of a frame:
the main camera pass consumes integer slots into the dense render projection,
and everything else (the portal virtual views, the split-screen second view,
the non-threaded editor) still walks brush dicts.

They are the same picture or the refactor changed what Fio renders.  So these
draw one scene both ways on a real GL context and compare the pixels -- which
is the only check that covers the whole chain at once: classification into
passes, the batched model and normal matrices, the face batching and its
texture ordering, the NATURAL/authored/FIT scale choice, and the colour and
overbright columns.
