"""Render-state preparation: everything the renderer is handed, built headless.

The logic thread does not draw anything.  It decides *what* will be drawn —
camera, frustum planes, the visible and all-brush lists, the per-frame snapshots
of moving geometry — and publishes that as a :class:`RenderState` for the Qt
view to consume.  None of that needs a GL context, so all of it is tested here;
the drawing itself is the ``gl``-marked visual tier.

The properties that matter are conservativeness (culling may never drop
something that is actually on screen) and isolation (the snapshot the renderer
reads must not change under it while the next frame is being built).
