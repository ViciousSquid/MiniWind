"""The logic thread against the UI thread that starts and stops play.

``QtGameView`` calls ``LogicThread.set_play_mode`` on the UI thread while the
logic thread is looping.  The flag used to be flipped first and the session
built after it — movers, doors, collision caches, the spatial grid, the Prop
session, the monster thread — with nothing stopping a tick from running in
between, so the first play-mode ticks could run against a half-built session
(and the last ones against a half-torn-down one).

These tests use real threads, bounded by explicit timeouts, and make the
interleaving deterministic by starting a frame from inside the transition.
