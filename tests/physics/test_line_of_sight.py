"""Line of sight: the dense path must answer exactly what the scalar one does.

``SpatialGrid.has_line_of_sight`` has two ways through the brushes a ray's
cells hold. The per-brush path deduplicates them through a set of ``id()``,
reads each one's AABB from its dict and runs the slab test in Python; the dense
path tests the static ones as rows of bounds the grid copied when it was
populated, all at once, and walks only the movers and doors.

They are one answer or the change moved a wall. The tests here drive both over
the same grid and compare, with the cases most likely to separate them:

* **grazing rays**, because the slab test is a comparison, and bounds derived
  any other way than through ``brush_aabb_bounds`` (float32, via ``glm.vec3``)
  differ by up to 3e-04 -- enough to decide one;
* **mesh-collision brushes**, because the grid files those by their mesh bounds
  while the narrow phase tests pos/size, so the cell a brush is *in* and the
  box that is *tested* are deliberately different things;
* **movers**, which move while the grid stands still.

The rows are the grid's own. Line of sight runs on the monster AI thread, and
it used to read the renderer's :class:`~engine.render_table.RenderTable`
instead -- a table the logic thread refreshes and reconciles every tick, and
which the double-buffered publication recycles one frame after the AI saw it.
